# XTT_Boxplot_significance
This script generates a boxplot for plate reader data in the 96-well format to compare the fold change between irradiated and control samples. 
A stutent's t-test is done and p-value levels between groups are shown with stars over the groups 
(* p < 0.05, ** p< 0.01, *** p< 0.001). 
To prepare the data for imput please use "Excel_Export_R.xlsx". 
The constants in the first part control the basics of the plot (like the titel but there are also options to exclude columns and rows of the plates). 
Please change these values to meet your needs.
